# My build of sfm - simple file manager

A version of the [simple file manager (sfm)][https://github.com/afify/sfm] tweaked and hacked to make it more for my liking: I don't need to say this, but all the credit and hard work goes to [afify][https://github.com/afify] for making the project in the first place.

# Features

Currently there's only one:

* Instead of binding keys directly to bookmarks, you can bind them to a "BMARK MODE" of sorts, making more space for other bindings.

# TODO

I intent to add more to this list as time goes on...

* Make a keybiding for the [dragon][https://github.com/mwh/dragon] utility.
* Make an Emacslike prompt for asking about file deletion.

# Installation

* You can basically follow the [guide on sfm's repo][https://github.com/afify/sfm#installation]. But the really short instructions are:
1. Clone the repo somewhere:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/arturfabriciohahaedgy/my-sfm
```

2. `cd` into the dir and build it:

``` sh
cd my-sfm
make
```

3. `Install it`

``` sh
sudo make install
```
